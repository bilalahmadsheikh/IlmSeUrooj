**Date:** 2026-02-21  
**Agent:** Claude Opus 4.6 via Google Antigravity  

## What Was Built

### University Config File
- `extension/universities.js` — 28 complete entries
- Each entry: slug, name, domain, altDomains, registrationUrl, submissionSelectors, confirmationSelectors, framework, notes, verified
- Helper functions for hostname lookup and domain listing

### Final Documentation
- `docs/agent/README.md` — technical overview
- `DECISIONS.md` — Decisions 6-8 added
- All 6 phase logs exist and are accurate

## Verification
- ✅ `npm run build` exits 0 (11 pages)
- ✅ All extension JS syntactically valid
- ✅ All docs updated and consistent
- ⚠️ Universities marked `verified: false` — need manual portal testing by user
